0,0,1,261,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,"love this dress  it's sooo pretty  i happened to find it in a store and i'm glad i did bc i never would have ordered it online bc it's petite  i bought a petite and am 5'8""  i love the length on me hits just a little below the knee  would definitely be a true midi on someone who is truly petite"
1,0,2,446,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,i had such high hopes for this dress and really wanted it to work for me i initially ordered the petite small (my usual size) but i found this to be outrageously small so small in fact that i could not zip it up i reordered it in petite medium which was just ok overall the top half was comfortable and fit nicely but the bottom half had a very tight under layer and several somewhat cheap (net) over layers imo a major design flaw was the net over layer sewn directly into the zipper  it c

4,0,5,434,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,i love tracy reese dresses but this one is not for the very petite i am just under 5 feet tall and usually wear a 0p in this brand this dress was very pretty out of the package but its a lot of dress the skirt is long and very full so it overwhelmed my small frame not a stranger to alterations shortening and narrowing the skirt would take away from the embellishment of the garment i love the color and the idea of the style but it just did not work on me i returned this dress
5,0,6,441,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,i aded this in my basket at hte last mintue to see what it would look like in person (store pick up) i went with teh darkler color only because i am so pale :) hte color is really gorgeous and turns out it mathced everythiing i was trying on with it prefectly it is a little baggy on me and hte xs is hte msallet size (bummer no petite) i decided to jkeep it though because as i said it matvehd everything my ejans pants and the 3 skirts i waas trying on (of which i ]kept all ) oops
6,0,7,423,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,i ordered this in carbon for store pick up and had a ton of stuff (as always) to try on and used this top to pair (skirts and pants) everything went with it the color is really nice charcoal with shimmer and went well with pencil skirts flare pants etc my only compaint is it is a bit big sleeves are long and it doesn't go in petite also a bit loose for me but no xxs so i kept it and wil ldecide later since the light color is already sold out in hte smallest size
7,0,8,132,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,i love this dress i usually get an xs but it runs a little snug in bust so i ordered up a size very flattering and feminine with the usual retailer flair for style
8,0,9,311,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,"i'm 5""5' and 125 lbs i ordered the s petite to make sure the length wasn't too long i typically wear an xs regular in retailer dresses if you're less busty (34b cup or smaller) a s petite will fit you perfectly (snug but not tight) i love that i could dress it up for a party or down for work i love that the tulle is longer then the fabric underneath"
9,0,10,293,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,dress runs small esp where the zipper area runs i ordered the sp which typically fits me and it was very tight the material on the top looks and feels very cheap that even just pulling on it will cause it to rip the fabric pretty disappointed as it was going to be my christmas dress this year needless to say it will be going back
10,0,11,39,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering
11,0,12,447,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,more and more i find myself reliant on the reviews written by savvy shoppers before me and for the most past they are right on in their estimation of the product in the case of this dressif it had not been for the reveiwsi doubt i would have even tried this the dress is beautifully made lined and reminiscent of the old retailer quality it is lined in the solid periwinklecolored fabric that matches the outer fabric print tts and very formfitting falls just above the knee and does not rid
12,0,13,327,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,"bought the black xs to go under the larkspur midi dress because they didn't bother lining the skirt portion (grrrrrrrrrrr)
my stats are 34a28/2936 and the xs fit very smoothly around the chest and was flowy around my lower half so i would say it's running big
the straps are very pretty and it could easily be nightwear too
i'm 5'6"" and it came to just below my knees"
13,0,14,451,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,this is a nice choice for holiday gatherings i like that the length grazes the knee so it is conservative enough for office related gatherings the size small fit me well  i am usually a size 2/4 with a small bust in my opinion it runs small and those with larger busts will definitely have to size up (but then perhaps the waist will be too big) the problem with this dress is the quality the fabrics are terrible the delicate netting type fabric on the top layer of skirt got stuck in the zip
14,0,15,407,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,i took these out of the package and wanted them to fit so badly but i could tell before i put them on that they wouldn't these are for an hourglass figure i am more straight up and down the waist was way too small for my body shape and even if i sized up i could tell they would still be tight in the waist and too roomy in the hips  for me that said they are really nice sturdy linenlike fabric pretty color well made i hope they make someone very happy
15,0,16,312,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,material and color is nice  the leg opening is very large  i am 5'1 (100#) and the length hits me right above my ankle  with a leg opening the size of my waist and hem line above my ankle and front pleats to make me fluffy i think you can imagine that it is not a flattering look  if you are at least average height or taller this may look good on you
16,0,17,249,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,took a chance on this blouse and so glad i did i wasn't crazy about how the blouse is photographed on the model i paired it whit white pants and it worked perfectly crisp and clean is how i would describe it launders well fits great drape is perfect wear tucked in or out  can't go wrong
17,0,18,130,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,a flattering super cozy coat  will work well for cold dry days and will look good with jeans or a dressier outfit  i am 5' 5'' about 135 and the small fits great
18,0,19,248,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,i love the look and feel of this tulle dress i was looking for something different but not over the top for new year's eve i'm small chested and the top of this dress is form fitting for a flattering look once i steamed the tulle it was perfect i ordered an xsp length was perfect too
19,0,20,251,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,"if this product was in petite i would get the petite the regular is a little long on me but a tailor can do a simple fix on that 

fits nicely i'm 5'4 130lb and pregnant so i bough t medium to grow into 

the tie can be front or back so provides for some nice flexibility on form fitting"
20,0,21,443,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,i'm upset because for the price of the dress i thought it was embroidered no that is a print on the fabric i think i cried a little when i opened the box it is still ver pretty i would say it is true to size it is a tad bit big on me but i am very tiny but i can still get away with it the color is vibrant the style is unique skirt portion is pretty poofy i keep going back and forth on it mainly because of the price although the quality is definitely there except i wish it were emb
21,0,22,389,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,"first of all this is not pullover styling there is a side zipper i wouldn't have purchased it if i knew there was a side zipper because i have a large bust and side zippers are next to impossible for me

second of all the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath

not at all what is looks like or is described as sadly will be returning but i'm sure i will find something to exchange it for"
22,0,23,166,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,cute little dress fits tts it is a little high waisted good length for my 5'9 height i like the dress i'm just not in love with it i dont think it looks or feels cheap it appears just as pictured
23,0,24,392,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,i love this shirt because when i first saw it i wasn't sure if it was a shirt or dress since it is seethrough if you wear it like a dress you will need a slip or wear it with leggings i bought a slip wore the tie in the back and rocked it with white wedges you could also wear it as a vest be careful with the buttons i haven't had any fall off yet but i feel like they will overall it's great for any occasion and it's fun to wear
24,0,25,293,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,"loved the material but i didnt really look at how long the dress was before i purchased both a large and a medium im 5'5"" and there was atleast 5"" of material at my feet the gaps in the front are much wider than they look felt like the dress just fell flat both were returned im usually a large and the med fit better 36d 30 in jeans"
25,0,26,453,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,i have been waiting for this sweater coat to ship for weeks and i was so excited for it to arrive this coat is not true to size and made me look short and squat the sleeves are very wide (although long) as a light weight fall coat the sleeves don't need to be as wide because you wouldn't be layerng too much underneath the buttons need to be moved at least three inches in for a nicer fit i thought about redoing the buttons myself but the sleeves looked even more out of proportion with a tigh
26,0,27,204,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,the colors weren't what i expected either the dark blue is much more vibrant and i just couldn't find anything to really go with it fabric is thick and good quality has nice weight and movement to it the skirt just wasn't for me in the end
27,0,28,152,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,i have several of goodhyouman shirts and i get so many compliments on them especially the one that says forehead kisses are underrated don't hesitate buy this shirt you won't be sorry
28,0,29,393,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,this sweater is so comfy and classic  it balances a quirky handknit look with a beautiful color and practical fit it is a bit cropped and boxy as part of the style and as others mentioned there are gaps in the knit that make it seethrough in my opinion this makes it perfect for layering i like having a longer camisole showing underneath or wearing it over a little dress it's warm but still thin enough to fit under a jacket or coat
29,0,30,71,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,beautifully made pants and on trend with the flared crop so much cuter in person love these
30,0,31,298,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,i never would have given these pants a second look online in person they are much cuter the stripes are brighter and the fit more flattering the crop has a cute flare which is right on trend this brand has always run small for me i am 5'8 about 140lbs and carry some chubbiness in the belly i paired it with a collarless loose navy blazer
31,0,32,68,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned
32,0,33,383,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,i ordered this 3 months ago and it finally came off back order a huge disappointment the fit wasn&#39;t so much the issue for me the quality of the wool is subpar someone else mentioned a &quot;felted wool&quot;i guess is that what you call it?  it does literally feel like felt super thin itchy doesn&#39;t drape very well and feels cheap (made in china) i got it on sale but still not worth what i paid definitely going back
33,0,34,222,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,this is such a neat dress the color is great and the fabric is super soft i am tall so the long length was an added bonus it definitely needs something underneath since the front gaps i am going to pair it with a funky tank top necklaces and boots super cute

42,0,43,436,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,"first this is thermal so naturally i didn't expect super sheer but it is really sheer light fabric i like it but be prepared for considering who you might run into if you walk around the house in it second it is large i ordered the size 0 and it's a nice oversized fit for my 5'3"" 125 pounds i wouldn't want to go larger along with being sheer the fabric is easily stretched which i don't mind in this case finally the color it looks white on my monitor and shows a colorful blue dot"
43,0,44,346,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,"tried this on today at my local retailer and had to have it it is so comfortable and flattering it's too bad the picture online has the model tucking it into the skirt because you can't see the ruching across the front a little dressier alternative to a plain tee and reasonably priced for retailer 5'8"""" and i generally wear a 6 the small fit well will probably be back for the black"
44,0,45,178,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,i bought this item from online the fit on the model looked a little loose but when i got mine it seemed a bit tight so i took it back to the store & ordered a larger size for the sale price this is a great top
45,0,46,141,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,i love this top i wear it all the time  the problem is that you can tell i wear it all the time as the fabric has started to fade  i'd still recommend it as it is so comfortable
46,0,47,50,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,very comfortable material is good cut out on sleeves flattering
47,0,48,59,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,this sweater is perfect for fallit's roomy warm super comfy and the color really pops
48,0,49,226,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,really cute top the embroidery on the collar & bib of this top is beautiful and unique received lots of compliments & questions about where i got it i'm rather busty up top and the medium fit well a small probably would've fit better but it's still super adorable
49,0,50,305,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,this is a cute top that can transition easily from summer to fall it fits well nice print and it's comfortable i tried this on in the store but did not purchase it because the color washed me out this is not the best color for a blonde would look much better on a brunette if this was in a different color i most likely would have purchased it
50,0,51,147,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,"i absolutely love this bib tee it's probably my favorite retailer purchase of all time i'm 5'7"" 140 pounds and the small was a perfect fit for me i typically wear either a s or m tops"
51,0,52,42,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,love the color and style but material snags easily
52,0,53,446,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,very soft and comfortable the shirt has an unusual asymmetrical seam that appears along the front righthand side of the garment (the model is positioned so that you can't see this detail from the picture i attached a picture that includes the front seam) i actually like the seam  it creates more visual interest and adds a little bit of ruching that helps hide my belly the cowl neck is very well done  there are two layers that form the cowl and i've found that it means wardrobe malfun
53,0,54,398,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,nice top armholes are a bit oversized but as an older woman i'm picky about that the print is pretty and unusual it just didn't look great on me there's a slight peplum in the back that hangs nicely it's a lightweight tee fabric that's opaque i tried it on with a black bra which was barely visible great for warmer climates but there are so many gorgeous tops out now that i decided to return since summer is winding down i do recommend
54,0,55,167,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,this is an adorable top that i find to be extremely comfortable i don't usually buy prints but this one is so feminine and looks great with dark wash jeans i am a 36d and the medium was a perfect fit
55,0,56,373,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,i am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra it's soft and fits okay but it has zero support or shape i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support if i would have seen this is the store i would have passed over it however i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it it's comfortable so that's a redeeming quality i would not recommend for larger chested ladies though
56,0,57,102,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,this tank fit well and i loved the ruffle in the back and how it layed but the front was not a good look and i will be retuning it
57,0,58,448,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,i got this in the petite length size o and it fit just right i like that i didn't have to have it altered in the length; can wear with flats with plenty of clearance to the floor from the bottom hem my only beef with the design is the height of the waist i personally think that the elastic waistband looks cheap and really needs to be concealed with a belt yet because it sits so high literally right under the bustline it's a tricky one to pull off i have a wide belt that sort of does th
58,0,59,240,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,i've been looking for bralettes that provide some support but not binding/tight for night time and casual wear this is a light weight bra could be a little more supportive pretty color with nice lines only downside is the retailer tag on the back  itchy (i need to remove it)
59,0,60,245,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,this dress is simply beautiful and stunning it is so figure flattering and i can't wait to wear it size small worked for me and since i'm tall it fell right to my ankle which is perfect for me i could not be happier with the purchase and the keyhole in the back is a beautiful detail
60,0,61,429,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,3 tags sewn in 2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3'') very itchy so i cut them out then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all also  i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work i am a b cup however this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup  so for me this would only be a lounging bralette  if it wasn't so itchy
61,0,62,164,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,i recently got this on sale after looking at it forever on my wish list i'm so happy with it its very comfortable and just long enough for my torso (5'3) the pattern on the front is very flattering

63,0,64,40,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,loved this top and was really happy to find it on sale
64,0,65,208,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,beautiful top but delicate i wore it to school and the straps on my backpack caused some pilling other than that it is beautiful and vibrant just make sure you aren't doing/wearing anything that will rub it continuously since the fabric is delicate
65,0,66,449,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,just received this in the mail tried it on and am smitten i'm usually a l but sometimes i'm a xl (if no stretch) in retailer tops i bought this one in l and i'm sure glad i did very flowy stretchy and comfortable i also bought the meda lace top from one september and they are very similar expect this is more of a tshirt and the other is more of a blouse i almost think i could've gotten a m in this because there is a lot of extra fabric at the chest which is usually never the issue for me
66,0,67,412,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,love this top i kept eyeing it online and wavering on size since my postbaby body is a little wonky i went with the xsp and miraculously it works perfectly so i would say it does run just a little large i love the length and usually do not go with petite sizes at retailer because i like the longer lengths of the regular but this is perfect on me and there is give up top so it looks lovely and it is very soft and comfortable this will be a goto top this season
67,0,68,300,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,i really loved this top online and wanted to love it in person it is soft and the patter is okay in person the neckline is higher than i am used to also there are two buttons in the back that must be unbuttoned in order to wear the top it is difficult to button them behind your neck with the top on unfortunately i had to return this item
68,0,69,221,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,i really wanted this to work alas it had a strange fit for me the straps would not stay up and it had a weird fit under the breast it worked standing up but the minute i sat down it fell off my shoulders the fabric was beautiful and i loved that it had pockets
69,0,70,419,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,"this top is so cute but it is massively babydoll shaped (a line) which is not apparent from the pictures i measured the xs i have and the chest is about 42"" and sweep is over 70"" i would definitely keep this top if it hung straighter the craftsmanship is lovely and fabric is so natural and handwoven looking i'm thinking about asking my tailor if she can take the sides in but that might ruin it as the fabric layout is cut and proportioned to this swing style"
70,0,71,447,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,why do designers keep making crop tops?? i can't imagine this would be flattering on anyone especially someone average height and well endowed on top i looked like a football player the pattern and fabric are gorgeous so if you are like 4' tall and super tiny and can fit xxs this may work? i am between a 68 and fit a small and it was huge on me and almost was bigger at the bottom than the top such a weird cut there is a cami underneath so if it rides up that will show but that is so 80s
71,0,72,448,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,"i have a short torso and this works well for me 34c bought the 0 there's not much stretch to the fabric so it is fitted to my chest but not in an uncomfortable way definitely doesn't hang and have extra fabric like on the model 

zipper goes almost all the way down to the bottom so it's easier to get on and off which makes up for the lack of stretch n the fabric

unlike another reviewer i found it went really well with navy pants and i wore it to a business meeting under a blazer wi"
72,0,73,201,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,i love this top it is loose and comfortable it is not sheer so you don't need a cami it runs a little large so size down if you want a more tailored fit 1 criticism it catches on sharp jewelry or belts and can pull if you are not careful
73,0,74,445,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,i passed up this dress so many times in the store and finally tried it on today because i wanted a casual dress while traveling in the cape i was surprised how much cuter it is on than on hanger i sized down to get a more fitting look and really made a difference for me in style i was not a fan of the way it looked so loose on model it looks really cute fitted and a bit sexy even it is lined and very comfy and can be dressed up a but for work with a cardi i believe i will get a lot of wear
74,0,75,447,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,"i am so drawn to baby doll and boxy shirts so i immediately tried this on in the store i am petite and only 5'2"" so usually shirts with a lot of fabric swallow me whole but this one was still cute there is a lot more fabric than the picture lets on but i think it is still super cute and flattering i would definitely check the size chart and read comments to see if someone with your same size description has recommended a specific size for your body type i am petite and weigh about 110 lbs"
75,0,76,239,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,i would have loved this dress if the bust and waist were just a little more fitted i am 32c and the top was too big fit perfectly on hips the lace material means it cannot be easily altered so i chose to return the dress i would have definitely kept it if it were a better fit
76,0,77,182,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,the zipper broke on this piece the first time i wore it very disappointing since i love the design i'm actually going to try to replace the zipper myself with something stronger but annoying that it's come to that
77,0,78,214,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,i usually size up with this brand small was perfect for me at 135lbs this top has a luxurious but casual feel and beautiful i am obsessed and want to wear it everyday it wears a little long and drapey but a little tight where it rolls up in the arms
78,0,79,405,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,this dress is adorable  it's a perfect casual look for summer and the quality is nice with the lining (though still overpriced in my opinion) the tie detail is somewhat adjustable and i found my normal size s to fit fine (5'7 128#) where this gets me is the fact that it's dry cleantotally doesn't make sense for a dress that is essentially a fancy tshirt for summer i might bring it back for that alone since i originally planned to wear it a lot :(
79,0,80,448,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,"i am usually a petite 6 but since this dress did not come in petites i tried on 4 and it fit i'm 5'1"" 112lbs so dress hit rt below knee will have it hemmed up a bit do not so overwhelming

this dress looks stunning on great vibrant color ( i have dark hair) makes this classic elegant dress look contemporary and stylish when i tried it on in store salesperson and others who happen to see it on me raved and told me to grab it i did and am glad

i plan to wear it this spring for my daughte"

81,0,82,447,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,the rest of the reviewers are right about the color being in accurately pictured i ordered the dark orange color and i recieved more of a dark cedar brown colored jacket the print is great i love it it's so different than any other jackets ive seen while the jacket is ã¼ber cute it is a bit bulky (though the waist tie helps with that) and its not heavy winter appropriate ( it's not waterproof or heavily insulated) for your average winter day though it will be a fun option the removable v
82,0,83,446,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,i purchased this top in an antro store last week the quality is wonderful and the greenish blue color is very unique the blouse has a beautiful stretchy camsiole that is attached at the shoulders but can be removed by snaps i tooks great when worn two different ways i wore it with the campole out and it peeks through the blouse at the bottom it also looks great when the camisole is worn in my only wish is that it would come in a petite size as it's a touch big at the shoulders and neckli
83,0,84,449,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,i received this shirt in my typical xs and it fits perfectly i?m not crazy in love with it but i also don?t dislike the shirt is on the thin side do i need to wear a cami underneath it no my concern is holes it does remind me of a material that could develop some holes after some wear and washes with that being said i?ll wash this shirt in cold water and hang dry and hopefully that will prevent holes from developing the length is fine and i do like the slits in front?it adds a little dim
84,0,85,446,absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable,"i was really hoping to like this but it did not look the way it does on the model at least not on me the sharkbite hem is much more pronounced and looser the one in the photo looks like it was pinned back i am 5'8"" and usually wear a medium or large i got a medium and there was a lot more material on the bottom half than the photo shows it made me look bigger and was not flattering material has a nice weave but it's thin and delicate i bought the (holly) deep olive and the blue colors"

343,3,53,407,i love love love this jumpsuit it's fun flirty and fabulous every time i wear it i get nothing but great compliments,very soft and comfortable the shirt has an unusual asymmetrical seam that appears along the front righthand side of the garment (the model is positioned so that you can't see this detail from the picture i attached a picture that includes the front seam) i actually like the seam  it creates more visual interest and adds a little bit of ruching that helps hide my belly the cowl neck is very well done  there are two layers that form the cowl and i've found that it means wardrobe malfun
344,3,54,357,i love love love this jumpsuit it's fun flirty and fabulous every time i wear it i get nothing but great compliments,nice top armholes are a bit oversized but as an older woman i'm picky about that the print is pretty and unusual it just didn't look great on me there's a slight peplum in the back that hangs nicely it's a lightweight tee fabric that's opaque i tried it on with a black bra which was barely visible great for warmer climates but there are so many gorgeous tops out now that i decided to return since summer is winding down i do recommend

349,3,59,206,i love love love this jumpsuit it's fun flirty and fabulous every time i wear it i get nothing but great compliments,i've been looking for bralettes that provide some support but not binding/tight for night time and casual wear this is a light weight bra could be a little more supportive pretty color with nice lines only downside is the retailer tag on the back  itchy (i need to remove it)

360,3,70,378,i love love love this jumpsuit it's fun flirty and fabulous every time i wear it i get nothing but great compliments,"this top is so cute but it is massively babydoll shaped (a line) which is not apparent from the pictures i measured the xs i have and the chest is about 42"" and sweep is over 70"" i would definitely keep this top if it hung straighter the craftsmanship is lovely and fabric is so natural and handwoven looking i'm thinking about asking my tailor if she can take the sides in but that might ruin it as the fabric layout is cut and proportioned to this swing style"
361,3,71,410,i love love love this jumpsuit it's fun flirty and fabulous every time i wear it i get nothing but great compliments,why do designers keep making crop tops?? i can't imagine this would be flattering on anyone especially someone average height and well endowed on top i looked like a football player the pattern and fabric are gorgeous so if you are like 4' tall and super tiny and can fit xxs this may work? i am between a 68 and fit a small and it was huge on me and almost was bigger at the bottom than the top such a weird cut there is a cami underneath so if it rides up that will show but that is so 80s

363,3,73,170,i love love love this jumpsuit it's fun flirty and fabulous every time i wear it i get nothing but great compliments,i love this top it is loose and comfortable it is not sheer so you don't need a cami it runs a little large so size down if you want a more tailored fit 1 criticism it catches on sharp jewelry or belts and can pull if you are not careful
364,3,74,411,i love love love this jumpsuit it's fun flirty and fabulous every time i wear it i get nothing but great compliments,i passed up this dress so many times in the store and finally tried it on today because i wanted a casual dress while traveling in the cape i was surprised how much cuter it is on than on hanger i sized down to get a more fitting look and really made a difference for me in style i was not a fan of the way it looked so loose on model it looks really cute fitted and a bit sexy even it is lined and very comfy and can be dressed up a but for work with a cardi i believe i will get a lot of wear

zipper goes almost all the way down to the bottom so it's easier to get on and off which makes up for the lack of stretch n the fabric

my stats are 34a28/2936 and the xs fit very smoothly around the chest and was flowy around my lower half so i would say it's running big
the straps are very pretty and it could easily be nightwear too
i'm 5'6"" and it came to just below my knees"

fits nicely i'm 5'4 130lb and pregnant so i bough t medium to grow into

second of all the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath

zipper goes almost all the way down to the bottom so it's easier to get on and off which makes up for the lack of stretch n the fabric

second of all the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath

not at all what is looks like or is described as sadly will be returning but i'm sure i will find something to exchange it for"

1046,11,24,386,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,i love this shirt because when i first saw it i wasn't sure if it was a shirt or dress since it is seethrough if you wear it like a dress you will need a slip or wear it with leggings i bought a slip wore the tie in the back and rocked it with white wedges you could also wear it as a vest be careful with the buttons i haven't had any fall off yet but i feel like they will overall it's great for any occasion and it's fun to wear

1048,11,26,452,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,i have been waiting for this sweater coat to ship for weeks and i was so excited for it to arrive this coat is not true to size and made me look short and squat the sleeves are very wide (although long) as a light weight fall coat the sleeves don't need to be as wide because you wouldn't be layerng too much underneath the buttons need to be moved at least three inches in for a nicer fit i thought about redoing the buttons myself but the sleeves looked even more out of proportion with a tigh

1051,11,29,391,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,this sweater is so comfy and classic  it balances a quirky handknit look with a beautiful color and practical fit it is a bit cropped and boxy as part of the style and as others mentioned there are gaps in the knit that make it seethrough in my opinion this makes it perfect for layering i like having a longer camisole showing underneath or wearing it over a little dress it's warm but still thin enough to fit under a jacket or coat

1055,11,33,381,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,i ordered this 3 months ago and it finally came off back order a huge disappointment the fit wasn&#39;t so much the issue for me the quality of the wool is subpar someone else mentioned a &quot;felted wool&quot;i guess is that what you call it?  it does literally feel like felt super thin itchy doesn&#39;t drape very well and feels cheap (made in china) i got it on sale but still not worth what i paid definitely going back

1065,11,43,438,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,"first this is thermal so naturally i didn't expect super sheer but it is really sheer light fabric i like it but be prepared for considering who you might run into if you walk around the house in it second it is large i ordered the size 0 and it's a nice oversized fit for my 5'3"" 125 pounds i wouldn't want to go larger along with being sheer the fabric is easily stretched which i don't mind in this case finally the color it looks white on my monitor and shows a colorful blue dot"
1066,11,44,342,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,"tried this on today at my local retailer and had to have it it is so comfortable and flattering it's too bad the picture online has the model tucking it into the skirt because you can't see the ruching across the front a little dressier alternative to a plain tee and reasonably priced for retailer 5'8"""" and i generally wear a 6 the small fit well will probably be back for the black"
1067,11,45,177,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,i bought this item from online the fit on the model looked a little loose but when i got mine it seemed a bit tight so i took it back to the store & ordered a larger size for the sale price this is a great top
1068,11,46,146,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,i love this top i wear it all the time  the problem is that you can tell i wear it all the time as the fabric has started to fade  i'd still recommend it as it is so comfortable

1074,11,52,41,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,love the color and style but material snags easily
1075,11,53,443,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,very soft and comfortable the shirt has an unusual asymmetrical seam that appears along the front righthand side of the garment (the model is positioned so that you can't see this detail from the picture i attached a picture that includes the front seam) i actually like the seam  it creates more visual interest and adds a little bit of ruching that helps hide my belly the cowl neck is very well done  there are two layers that form the cowl and i've found that it means wardrobe malfun
1076,11,54,395,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,nice top armholes are a bit oversized but as an older woman i'm picky about that the print is pretty and unusual it just didn't look great on me there's a slight peplum in the back that hangs nicely it's a lightweight tee fabric that's opaque i tried it on with a black bra which was barely visible great for warmer climates but there are so many gorgeous tops out now that i decided to return since summer is winding down i do recommend
1077,11,55,162,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,this is an adorable top that i find to be extremely comfortable i don't usually buy prints but this one is so feminine and looks great with dark wash jeans i am a 36d and the medium was a perfect fit
1078,11,56,372,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,i am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra it's soft and fits okay but it has zero support or shape i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support if i would have seen this is the store i would have passed over it however i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it it's comfortable so that's a redeeming quality i would not recommend for larger chested ladies though
1079,11,57,98,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,this tank fit well and i loved the ruffle in the back and how it layed but the front was not a good look and i will be retuning it
1080,11,58,448,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,i got this in the petite length size o and it fit just right i like that i didn't have to have it altered in the length; can wear with flats with plenty of clearance to the floor from the bottom hem my only beef with the design is the height of the waist i personally think that the elastic waistband looks cheap and really needs to be concealed with a belt yet because it sits so high literally right under the bustline it's a tricky one to pull off i have a wide belt that sort of does th
1081,11,59,235,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,i've been looking for bralettes that provide some support but not binding/tight for night time and casual wear this is a light weight bra could be a little more supportive pretty color with nice lines only downside is the retailer tag on the back  itchy (i need to remove it)
1082,11,60,238,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,this dress is simply beautiful and stunning it is so figure flattering and i can't wait to wear it size small worked for me and since i'm tall it fell right to my ankle which is perfect for me i could not be happier with the purchase and the keyhole in the back is a beautiful detail
1083,11,61,430,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,3 tags sewn in 2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3'') very itchy so i cut them out then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all also  i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work i am a b cup however this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup  so for me this would only be a lounging bralette  if it wasn't so itchy
1084,11,62,156,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,i recently got this on sale after looking at it forever on my wish list i'm so happy with it its very comfortable and just long enough for my torso (5'3) the pattern on the front is very flattering

1087,11,65,213,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,beautiful top but delicate i wore it to school and the straps on my backpack caused some pilling other than that it is beautiful and vibrant just make sure you aren't doing/wearing anything that will rub it continuously since the fabric is delicate
1088,11,66,448,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,just received this in the mail tried it on and am smitten i'm usually a l but sometimes i'm a xl (if no stretch) in retailer tops i bought this one in l and i'm sure glad i did very flowy stretchy and comfortable i also bought the meda lace top from one september and they are very similar expect this is more of a tshirt and the other is more of a blouse i almost think i could've gotten a m in this because there is a lot of extra fabric at the chest which is usually never the issue for me
1089,11,67,417,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,love this top i kept eyeing it online and wavering on size since my postbaby body is a little wonky i went with the xsp and miraculously it works perfectly so i would say it does run just a little large i love the length and usually do not go with petite sizes at retailer because i like the longer lengths of the regular but this is perfect on me and there is give up top so it looks lovely and it is very soft and comfortable this will be a goto top this season
1090,11,68,298,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,i really loved this top online and wanted to love it in person it is soft and the patter is okay in person the neckline is higher than i am used to also there are two buttons in the back that must be unbuttoned in order to wear the top it is difficult to button them behind your neck with the top on unfortunately i had to return this item
1091,11,69,222,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,i really wanted this to work alas it had a strange fit for me the straps would not stay up and it had a weird fit under the breast it worked standing up but the minute i sat down it fell off my shoulders the fabric was beautiful and i loved that it had pockets
1092,11,70,414,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,"this top is so cute but it is massively babydoll shaped (a line) which is not apparent from the pictures i measured the xs i have and the chest is about 42"" and sweep is over 70"" i would definitely keep this top if it hung straighter the craftsmanship is lovely and fabric is so natural and handwoven looking i'm thinking about asking my tailor if she can take the sides in but that might ruin it as the fabric layout is cut and proportioned to this swing style"
1093,11,71,448,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,why do designers keep making crop tops?? i can't imagine this would be flattering on anyone especially someone average height and well endowed on top i looked like a football player the pattern and fabric are gorgeous so if you are like 4' tall and super tiny and can fit xxs this may work? i am between a 68 and fit a small and it was huge on me and almost was bigger at the bottom than the top such a weird cut there is a cami underneath so if it rides up that will show but that is so 80s
1094,11,72,446,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,"i have a short torso and this works well for me 34c bought the 0 there's not much stretch to the fabric so it is fitted to my chest but not in an uncomfortable way definitely doesn't hang and have extra fabric like on the model 

zipper goes almost all the way down to the bottom so it's easier to get on and off which makes up for the lack of stretch n the fabric

unlike another reviewer i found it went really well with navy pants and i wore it to a business meeting under a blazer wi"
1095,11,73,199,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,i love this top it is loose and comfortable it is not sheer so you don't need a cami it runs a little large so size down if you want a more tailored fit 1 criticism it catches on sharp jewelry or belts and can pull if you are not careful
1096,11,74,448,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,i passed up this dress so many times in the store and finally tried it on today because i wanted a casual dress while traveling in the cape i was surprised how much cuter it is on than on hanger i sized down to get a more fitting look and really made a difference for me in style i was not a fan of the way it looked so loose on model it looks really cute fitted and a bit sexy even it is lined and very comfy and can be dressed up a but for work with a cardi i believe i will get a lot of wear
1097,11,75,447,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,"i am so drawn to baby doll and boxy shirts so i immediately tried this on in the store i am petite and only 5'2"" so usually shirts with a lot of fabric swallow me whole but this one was still cute there is a lot more fabric than the picture lets on but i think it is still super cute and flattering i would definitely check the size chart and read comments to see if someone with your same size description has recommended a specific size for your body type i am petite and weigh about 110 lbs"
1098,11,76,233,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,i would have loved this dress if the bust and waist were just a little more fitted i am 32c and the top was too big fit perfectly on hips the lace material means it cannot be easily altered so i chose to return the dress i would have definitely kept it if it were a better fit
1099,11,77,176,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,the zipper broke on this piece the first time i wore it very disappointing since i love the design i'm actually going to try to replace the zipper myself with something stronger but annoying that it's come to that

1101,11,79,402,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,this dress is adorable  it's a perfect casual look for summer and the quality is nice with the lining (though still overpriced in my opinion) the tie detail is somewhat adjustable and i found my normal size s to fit fine (5'7 128#) where this gets me is the fact that it's dry cleantotally doesn't make sense for a dress that is essentially a fancy tshirt for summer i might bring it back for that alone since i originally planned to wear it a lot :(
1102,11,80,445,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,"i am usually a petite 6 but since this dress did not come in petites i tried on 4 and it fit i'm 5'1"" 112lbs so dress hit rt below knee will have it hemmed up a bit do not so overwhelming

1105,11,83,447,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,i purchased this top in an antro store last week the quality is wonderful and the greenish blue color is very unique the blouse has a beautiful stretchy camsiole that is attached at the shoulders but can be removed by snaps i tooks great when worn two different ways i wore it with the campole out and it peeks through the blouse at the bottom it also looks great when the camisole is worn in my only wish is that it would come in a petite size as it's a touch big at the shoulders and neckli
1106,11,84,446,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,i received this shirt in my typical xs and it fits perfectly i?m not crazy in love with it but i also don?t dislike the shirt is on the thin side do i need to wear a cami underneath it no my concern is holes it does remind me of a material that could develop some holes after some wear and washes with that being said i?ll wash this shirt in cold water and hang dry and hopefully that will prevent holes from developing the length is fine and i do like the slits in front?it adds a little dim

1109,11,87,437,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,"i debated n that as i think it looks loose on the model but if i was to tighten it it looks a lot more flattering i tried on the xs in the store (i usually do that to decide if i need petite) and it looked huge when we pinched the back to see if xxs would work it was a lot of fabric and looser didn't look as good on me but i like the dress overall so still recommend and for those who like the looser look this is great i would however order eptite for 5'15"" (115 lbs 03 dd che"

1113,11,91,350,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,this top is so much prettier in real life than it is on the model the pattern and texture are both lovely and the peplum is surprisingly flattering it is definitely on the short side but i think that gives it a modern look the fabric does not stretch at all but i still think it fits tts if you have a very large chest you may want to go up a size but otherwise i would order your normal size
1114,11,92,440,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,this shirt caught my eye because of how beautiful it was i love the shape design and and the color it's perfect for spring and summer with some white pants unfortunately i don't see any possibilities for this shirt to be worn any other way so far it doesn't work with any of my jeans skirts or shorts i usually prefer items with more versatility for outfits so i'm still on the fence if i'm going to keep it or not with that aside it seriously is a great quality shirt with a beautiful

1118,11,96,425,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,i am in need of easy comfortable tops for everyday wear i bought this top mostly because of the cute buttons when i received it it looked exactly as it does in the picture online however the buttons kept slipping out of their homes because the holes were slightly too big the shirt fit but was just a tad snug near the upper arms which would stretch and loosen up throughout the day it's definitely a comfortable shirt but it felt more like a pajama top it's going back
1119,11,97,198,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,at first i wasn't sure about it the neckline is much lower and wavy than i thought but after wearing it it really is comfortable it stretches a lot so i wear a cami underneath so when i lean forward i'm not showing the world my torso
1120,11,98,374,this dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,i find that this brand can be a little bit allovertheplace with sizes had i tried this on in person i may have bought it in a small instead of a m despite being a bit big it still looks great and hides my flaws well i bought a m in another shirt from them (the seamed scoop neck) and that shirt was a full 2 inches smaller in the bust than this just something to keep in mind still a great shirt love the neutral color

1122,12,13,356,more and more i find myself reliant on the reviews written by savvy shoppers before me and for the most past they are right on in their estimation of the product in the case of this dressif it had not been for the reveiwsi doubt i would have even tried this the dress is beautifully made lined and reminiscent of the old retailer quality it is lined in the solid periwinklecolored fabric that matches the outer fabric print tts and very formfitting falls just above the knee and does not rid,"bought the black xs to go under the larkspur midi dress because they didn't bother lining the skirt portion (grrrrrrrrrrr)
my stats are 34a28/2936 and the xs fit very smoothly around the chest and was flowy around my lower half so i would say it's running big
the straps are very pretty and it could easily be nightwear too

zipper goes almost all the way down to the bottom so it's easier to get on and off which makes up for the lack of stretch n the fabric

this dress looks stunning on great vibrant color ( i have dark hair) makes this classic elegant dress look contemporary and stylish when i tried it on in store salesperson and others who happen to see it on me raved and told me to grab it i did and am glad

zipper goes almost all the way down to the bottom so it's easier to get on and off which makes up for the lack of stretch n the fabric

zipper goes almost all the way down to the bottom so it's easier to get on and off which makes up for the lack of stretch n the fabric

2557,30,53,412,beautifully made pants and on trend with the flared crop so much cuter in person love these,very soft and comfortable the shirt has an unusual asymmetrical seam that appears along the front righthand side of the garment (the model is positioned so that you can't see this detail from the picture i attached a picture that includes the front seam) i actually like the seam  it creates more visual interest and adds a little bit of ruching that helps hide my belly the cowl neck is very well done  there are two layers that form the cowl and i've found that it means wardrobe malfun
2558,30,54,368,beautifully made pants and on trend with the flared crop so much cuter in person love these,nice top armholes are a bit oversized but as an older woman i'm picky about that the print is pretty and unusual it just didn't look great on me there's a slight peplum in the back that hangs nicely it's a lightweight tee fabric that's opaque i tried it on with a black bra which was barely visible great for warmer climates but there are so many gorgeous tops out now that i decided to return since summer is winding down i do recommend
2559,30,55,154,beautifully made pants and on trend with the flared crop so much cuter in person love these,this is an adorable top that i find to be extremely comfortable i don't usually buy prints but this one is so feminine and looks great with dark wash jeans i am a 36d and the medium was a perfect fit
2560,30,56,350,beautifully made pants and on trend with the flared crop so much cuter in person love these,i am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra it's soft and fits okay but it has zero support or shape i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support if i would have seen this is the store i would have passed over it however i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it it's comfortable so that's a redeeming quality i would not recommend for larger chested ladies though
2561,30,57,97,beautifully made pants and on trend with the flared crop so much cuter in person love these,this tank fit well and i loved the ruffle in the back and how it layed but the front was not a good look and i will be retuning it
2562,30,58,417,beautifully made pants and on trend with the flared crop so much cuter in person love these,i got this in the petite length size o and it fit just right i like that i didn't have to have it altered in the length; can wear with flats with plenty of clearance to the floor from the bottom hem my only beef with the design is the height of the waist i personally think that the elastic waistband looks cheap and really needs to be concealed with a belt yet because it sits so high literally right under the bustline it's a tricky one to pull off i have a wide belt that sort of does th
2563,30,59,217,beautifully made pants and on trend with the flared crop so much cuter in person love these,i've been looking for bralettes that provide some support but not binding/tight for night time and casual wear this is a light weight bra could be a little more supportive pretty color with nice lines only downside is the retailer tag on the back  itchy (i need to remove it)
2564,30,60,220,beautifully made pants and on trend with the flared crop so much cuter in person love these,this dress is simply beautiful and stunning it is so figure flattering and i can't wait to wear it size small worked for me and since i'm tall it fell right to my ankle which is perfect for me i could not be happier with the purchase and the keyhole in the back is a beautiful detail
2565,30,61,404,beautifully made pants and on trend with the flared crop so much cuter in person love these,3 tags sewn in 2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3'') very itchy so i cut them out then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all also  i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work i am a b cup however this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup  so for me this would only be a lounging bralette  if it wasn't so itchy

2569,30,65,185,beautifully made pants and on trend with the flared crop so much cuter in person love these,beautiful top but delicate i wore it to school and the straps on my backpack caused some pilling other than that it is beautiful and vibrant just make sure you aren't doing/wearing anything that will rub it continuously since the fabric is delicate
2570,30,66,417,beautifully made pants and on trend with the flared crop so much cuter in person love these,just received this in the mail tried it on and am smitten i'm usually a l but sometimes i'm a xl (if no stretch) in retailer tops i bought this one in l and i'm sure glad i did very flowy stretchy and comfortable i also bought the meda lace top from one september and they are very similar expect this is more of a tshirt and the other is more of a blouse i almost think i could've gotten a m in this because there is a lot of extra fabric at the chest which is usually never the issue for me
2571,30,67,392,beautifully made pants and on trend with the flared crop so much cuter in person love these,love this top i kept eyeing it online and wavering on size since my postbaby body is a little wonky i went with the xsp and miraculously it works perfectly so i would say it does run just a little large i love the length and usually do not go with petite sizes at retailer because i like the longer lengths of the regular but this is perfect on me and there is give up top so it looks lovely and it is very soft and comfortable this will be a goto top this season
2572,30,68,273,beautifully made pants and on trend with the flared crop so much cuter in person love these,i really loved this top online and wanted to love it in person it is soft and the patter is okay in person the neckline is higher than i am used to also there are two buttons in the back that must be unbuttoned in order to wear the top it is difficult to button them behind your neck with the top on unfortunately i had to return this item
2573,30,69,201,beautifully made pants and on trend with the flared crop so much cuter in person love these,i really wanted this to work alas it had a strange fit for me the straps would not stay up and it had a weird fit under the breast it worked standing up but the minute i sat down it fell off my shoulders the fabric was beautiful and i loved that it had pockets
2574,30,70,391,beautifully made pants and on trend with the flared crop so much cuter in person love these,"this top is so cute but it is massively babydoll shaped (a line) which is not apparent from the pictures i measured the xs i have and the chest is about 42"" and sweep is over 70"" i would definitely keep this top if it hung straighter the craftsmanship is lovely and fabric is so natural and handwoven looking i'm thinking about asking my tailor if she can take the sides in but that might ruin it as the fabric layout is cut and proportioned to this swing style"
2575,30,71,421,beautifully made pants and on trend with the flared crop so much cuter in person love these,why do designers keep making crop tops?? i can't imagine this would be flattering on anyone especially someone average height and well endowed on top i looked like a football player the pattern and fabric are gorgeous so if you are like 4' tall and super tiny and can fit xxs this may work? i am between a 68 and fit a small and it was huge on me and almost was bigger at the bottom than the top such a weird cut there is a cami underneath so if it rides up that will show but that is so 80s
2576,30,72,421,beautifully made pants and on trend with the flared crop so much cuter in person love these,"i have a short torso and this works well for me 34c bought the 0 there's not much stretch to the fabric so it is fitted to my chest but not in an uncomfortable way definitely doesn't hang and have extra fabric like on the model 

zipper goes almost all the way down to the bottom so it's easier to get on and off which makes up for the lack of stretch n the fabric

unlike another reviewer i found it went really well with navy pants and i wore it to a business meeting under a blazer wi"
2577,30,73,182,beautifully made pants and on trend with the flared crop so much cuter in person love these,i love this top it is loose and comfortable it is not sheer so you don't need a cami it runs a little large so size down if you want a more tailored fit 1 criticism it catches on sharp jewelry or belts and can pull if you are not careful
2578,30,74,425,beautifully made pants and on trend with the flared crop so much cuter in person love these,i passed up this dress so many times in the store and finally tried it on today because i wanted a casual dress while traveling in the cape i was surprised how much cuter it is on than on hanger i sized down to get a more fitting look and really made a difference for me in style i was not a fan of the way it looked so loose on model it looks really cute fitted and a bit sexy even it is lined and very comfy and can be dressed up a but for work with a cardi i believe i will get a lot of wear
2579,30,75,424,beautifully made pants and on trend with the flared crop so much cuter in person love these,"i am so drawn to baby doll and boxy shirts so i immediately tried this on in the store i am petite and only 5'2"" so usually shirts with a lot of fabric swallow me whole but this one was still cute there is a lot more fabric than the picture lets on but i think it is still super cute and flattering i would definitely check the size chart and read comments to see if someone with your same size description has recommended a specific size for your body type i am petite and weigh about 110 lbs"
2580,30,76,219,beautifully made pants and on trend with the flared crop so much cuter in person love these,i would have loved this dress if the bust and waist were just a little more fitted i am 32c and the top was too big fit perfectly on hips the lace material means it cannot be easily altered so i chose to return the dress i would have definitely kept it if it were a better fit

2691,32,52,71,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,love the color and style but material snags easily
2692,32,53,412,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,very soft and comfortable the shirt has an unusual asymmetrical seam that appears along the front righthand side of the garment (the model is positioned so that you can't see this detail from the picture i attached a picture that includes the front seam) i actually like the seam  it creates more visual interest and adds a little bit of ruching that helps hide my belly the cowl neck is very well done  there are two layers that form the cowl and i've found that it means wardrobe malfun
2693,32,54,366,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,nice top armholes are a bit oversized but as an older woman i'm picky about that the print is pretty and unusual it just didn't look great on me there's a slight peplum in the back that hangs nicely it's a lightweight tee fabric that's opaque i tried it on with a black bra which was barely visible great for warmer climates but there are so many gorgeous tops out now that i decided to return since summer is winding down i do recommend
2694,32,55,149,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,this is an adorable top that i find to be extremely comfortable i don't usually buy prints but this one is so feminine and looks great with dark wash jeans i am a 36d and the medium was a perfect fit
2695,32,56,348,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,i am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra it's soft and fits okay but it has zero support or shape i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support if i would have seen this is the store i would have passed over it however i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it it's comfortable so that's a redeeming quality i would not recommend for larger chested ladies though
2696,32,57,91,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,this tank fit well and i loved the ruffle in the back and how it layed but the front was not a good look and i will be retuning it
2697,32,58,409,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,i got this in the petite length size o and it fit just right i like that i didn't have to have it altered in the length; can wear with flats with plenty of clearance to the floor from the bottom hem my only beef with the design is the height of the waist i personally think that the elastic waistband looks cheap and really needs to be concealed with a belt yet because it sits so high literally right under the bustline it's a tricky one to pull off i have a wide belt that sort of does th
2698,32,59,209,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,i've been looking for bralettes that provide some support but not binding/tight for night time and casual wear this is a light weight bra could be a little more supportive pretty color with nice lines only downside is the retailer tag on the back  itchy (i need to remove it)
2699,32,60,221,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,this dress is simply beautiful and stunning it is so figure flattering and i can't wait to wear it size small worked for me and since i'm tall it fell right to my ankle which is perfect for me i could not be happier with the purchase and the keyhole in the back is a beautiful detail
2700,32,61,401,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,3 tags sewn in 2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3'') very itchy so i cut them out then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all also  i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work i am a b cup however this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup  so for me this would only be a lounging bralette  if it wasn't so itchy
2701,32,62,148,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,i recently got this on sale after looking at it forever on my wish list i'm so happy with it its very comfortable and just long enough for my torso (5'3) the pattern on the front is very flattering

2704,32,65,195,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,beautiful top but delicate i wore it to school and the straps on my backpack caused some pilling other than that it is beautiful and vibrant just make sure you aren't doing/wearing anything that will rub it continuously since the fabric is delicate
2705,32,66,419,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,just received this in the mail tried it on and am smitten i'm usually a l but sometimes i'm a xl (if no stretch) in retailer tops i bought this one in l and i'm sure glad i did very flowy stretchy and comfortable i also bought the meda lace top from one september and they are very similar expect this is more of a tshirt and the other is more of a blouse i almost think i could've gotten a m in this because there is a lot of extra fabric at the chest which is usually never the issue for me
2706,32,67,387,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,love this top i kept eyeing it online and wavering on size since my postbaby body is a little wonky i went with the xsp and miraculously it works perfectly so i would say it does run just a little large i love the length and usually do not go with petite sizes at retailer because i like the longer lengths of the regular but this is perfect on me and there is give up top so it looks lovely and it is very soft and comfortable this will be a goto top this season
2707,32,68,267,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,i really loved this top online and wanted to love it in person it is soft and the patter is okay in person the neckline is higher than i am used to also there are two buttons in the back that must be unbuttoned in order to wear the top it is difficult to button them behind your neck with the top on unfortunately i had to return this item
2708,32,69,203,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,i really wanted this to work alas it had a strange fit for me the straps would not stay up and it had a weird fit under the breast it worked standing up but the minute i sat down it fell off my shoulders the fabric was beautiful and i loved that it had pockets
2709,32,70,385,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,"this top is so cute but it is massively babydoll shaped (a line) which is not apparent from the pictures i measured the xs i have and the chest is about 42"" and sweep is over 70"" i would definitely keep this top if it hung straighter the craftsmanship is lovely and fabric is so natural and handwoven looking i'm thinking about asking my tailor if she can take the sides in but that might ruin it as the fabric layout is cut and proportioned to this swing style"
2710,32,71,418,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,why do designers keep making crop tops?? i can't imagine this would be flattering on anyone especially someone average height and well endowed on top i looked like a football player the pattern and fabric are gorgeous so if you are like 4' tall and super tiny and can fit xxs this may work? i am between a 68 and fit a small and it was huge on me and almost was bigger at the bottom than the top such a weird cut there is a cami underneath so if it rides up that will show but that is so 80s
2711,32,72,416,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,"i have a short torso and this works well for me 34c bought the 0 there's not much stretch to the fabric so it is fitted to my chest but not in an uncomfortable way definitely doesn't hang and have extra fabric like on the model 

zipper goes almost all the way down to the bottom so it's easier to get on and off which makes up for the lack of stretch n the fabric

unlike another reviewer i found it went really well with navy pants and i wore it to a business meeting under a blazer wi"
2712,32,73,179,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,i love this top it is loose and comfortable it is not sheer so you don't need a cami it runs a little large so size down if you want a more tailored fit 1 criticism it catches on sharp jewelry or belts and can pull if you are not careful
2713,32,74,416,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,i passed up this dress so many times in the store and finally tried it on today because i wanted a casual dress while traveling in the cape i was surprised how much cuter it is on than on hanger i sized down to get a more fitting look and really made a difference for me in style i was not a fan of the way it looked so loose on model it looks really cute fitted and a bit sexy even it is lined and very comfy and can be dressed up a but for work with a cardi i believe i will get a lot of wear
2714,32,75,421,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,"i am so drawn to baby doll and boxy shirts so i immediately tried this on in the store i am petite and only 5'2"" so usually shirts with a lot of fabric swallow me whole but this one was still cute there is a lot more fabric than the picture lets on but i think it is still super cute and flattering i would definitely check the size chart and read comments to see if someone with your same size description has recommended a specific size for your body type i am petite and weigh about 110 lbs"
2715,32,76,214,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,i would have loved this dress if the bust and waist were just a little more fitted i am 32c and the top was too big fit perfectly on hips the lace material means it cannot be easily altered so i chose to return the dress i would have definitely kept it if it were a better fit
2716,32,77,157,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,the zipper broke on this piece the first time i wore it very disappointing since i love the design i'm actually going to try to replace the zipper myself with something stronger but annoying that it's come to that
2717,32,78,195,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,i usually size up with this brand small was perfect for me at 135lbs this top has a luxurious but casual feel and beautiful i am obsessed and want to wear it everyday it wears a little long and drapey but a little tight where it rolls up in the arms
2718,32,79,374,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,this dress is adorable  it's a perfect casual look for summer and the quality is nice with the lining (though still overpriced in my opinion) the tie detail is somewhat adjustable and i found my normal size s to fit fine (5'7 128#) where this gets me is the fact that it's dry cleantotally doesn't make sense for a dress that is essentially a fancy tshirt for summer i might bring it back for that alone since i originally planned to wear it a lot :(
2719,32,80,418,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,"i am usually a petite 6 but since this dress did not come in petites i tried on 4 and it fit i'm 5'1"" 112lbs so dress hit rt below knee will have it hemmed up a bit do not so overwhelming

this dress looks stunning on great vibrant color ( i have dark hair) makes this classic elegant dress look contemporary and stylish when i tried it on in store salesperson and others who happen to see it on me raved and told me to grab it i did and am glad

i plan to wear it this spring for my daughte"

2721,32,82,416,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,the rest of the reviewers are right about the color being in accurately pictured i ordered the dark orange color and i recieved more of a dark cedar brown colored jacket the print is great i love it it's so different than any other jackets ive seen while the jacket is ã¼ber cute it is a bit bulky (though the waist tie helps with that) and its not heavy winter appropriate ( it's not waterproof or heavily insulated) for your average winter day though it will be a fun option the removable v
2722,32,83,418,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,i purchased this top in an antro store last week the quality is wonderful and the greenish blue color is very unique the blouse has a beautiful stretchy camsiole that is attached at the shoulders but can be removed by snaps i tooks great when worn two different ways i wore it with the campole out and it peeks through the blouse at the bottom it also looks great when the camisole is worn in my only wish is that it would come in a petite size as it's a touch big at the shoulders and neckli
2723,32,84,419,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,i received this shirt in my typical xs and it fits perfectly i?m not crazy in love with it but i also don?t dislike the shirt is on the thin side do i need to wear a cami underneath it no my concern is holes it does remind me of a material that could develop some holes after some wear and washes with that being said i?ll wash this shirt in cold water and hang dry and hopefully that will prevent holes from developing the length is fine and i do like the slits in front?it adds a little dim
2724,32,85,416,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,"i was really hoping to like this but it did not look the way it does on the model at least not on me the sharkbite hem is much more pronounced and looser the one in the photo looks like it was pinned back i am 5'8"" and usually wear a medium or large i got a medium and there was a lot more material on the bottom half than the photo shows it made me look bigger and was not flattering material has a nice weave but it's thin and delicate i bought the (holly) deep olive and the blue colors"

te blue is a light blue almost neutral with the white embroidery i think it looked stylish and decided to keep it the peplum part hit just in the right spot i am short (petite) but my torso is normal size"
2726,32,87,409,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,"i debated n that as i think it looks loose on the model but if i was to tighten it it looks a lot more flattering i tried on the xs in the store (i usually do that to decide if i need petite) and it looked huge when we pinched the back to see if xxs would work it was a lot of fabric and looser didn't look as good on me but i like the dress overall so still recommend and for those who like the looser look this is great i would however order eptite for 5'15"" (115 lbs 03 dd che"

2729,32,90,313,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,i love cute summer dresses and this one especially because it is made out of linen is unique it is very wellmade with a design that is quite flattering i am 5 foot 6 and a little curvy with a 38 c bust and i got a size 10 it fits well although it is difficult to zip up because the material has no give the perfect dress to wear to italy or france now i just have to book my tickets
2730,32,91,319,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,this top is so much prettier in real life than it is on the model the pattern and texture are both lovely and the peplum is surprisingly flattering it is definitely on the short side but i think that gives it a modern look the fabric does not stretch at all but i still think it fits tts if you have a very large chest you may want to go up a size but otherwise i would order your normal size
2731,32,92,410,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,this shirt caught my eye because of how beautiful it was i love the shape design and and the color it's perfect for spring and summer with some white pants unfortunately i don't see any possibilities for this shirt to be worn any other way so far it doesn't work with any of my jeans skirts or shorts i usually prefer items with more versatility for outfits so i'm still on the fence if i'm going to keep it or not with that aside it seriously is a great quality shirt with a beautiful

2735,32,96,399,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,i am in need of easy comfortable tops for everyday wear i bought this top mostly because of the cute buttons when i received it it looked exactly as it does in the picture online however the buttons kept slipping out of their homes because the holes were slightly too big the shirt fit but was just a tad snug near the upper arms which would stretch and loosen up throughout the day it's definitely a comfortable shirt but it felt more like a pajama top it's going back
2736,32,97,178,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,at first i wasn't sure about it the neckline is much lower and wavy than i thought but after wearing it it really is comfortable it stretches a lot so i wear a cami underneath so when i lean forward i'm not showing the world my torso
2737,32,98,348,these pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,i find that this brand can be a little bit allovertheplace with sizes had i tried this on in person i may have bought it in a small instead of a m despite being a bit big it still looks great and hides my flaws well i bought a m in another shirt from them (the seamed scoop neck) and that shirt was a full 2 inches smaller in the bust than this just something to keep in mind still a great shirt love the neutral color

2887,35,53,419,wouldn't have given them a second look but tried them on in store of a whim love love,very soft and comfortable the shirt has an unusual asymmetrical seam that appears along the front righthand side of the garment (the model is positioned so that you can't see this detail from the picture i attached a picture that includes the front seam) i actually like the seam  it creates more visual interest and adds a little bit of ruching that helps hide my belly the cowl neck is very well done  there are two layers that form the cowl and i've found that it means wardrobe malfun
2888,35,54,374,wouldn't have given them a second look but tried them on in store of a whim love love,nice top armholes are a bit oversized but as an older woman i'm picky about that the print is pretty and unusual it just didn't look great on me there's a slight peplum in the back that hangs nicely it's a lightweight tee fabric that's opaque i tried it on with a black bra which was barely visible great for warmer climates but there are so many gorgeous tops out now that i decided to return since summer is winding down i do recommend

2890,35,56,354,wouldn't have given them a second look but tried them on in store of a whim love love,i am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra it's soft and fits okay but it has zero support or shape i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support if i would have seen this is the store i would have passed over it however i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it it's comfortable so that's a redeeming quality i would not recommend for larger chested ladies though

2894,35,60,229,wouldn't have given them a second look but tried them on in store of a whim love love,this dress is simply beautiful and stunning it is so figure flattering and i can't wait to wear it size small worked for me and since i'm tall it fell right to my ankle which is perfect for me i could not be happier with the purchase and the keyhole in the back is a beautiful detail
2895,35,61,402,wouldn't have given them a second look but tried them on in store of a whim love love,3 tags sewn in 2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3'') very itchy so i cut them out then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all also  i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work i am a b cup however this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup  so for me this would only be a lounging bralette  if it wasn't so itchy

2901,35,67,397,wouldn't have given them a second look but tried them on in store of a whim love love,love this top i kept eyeing it online and wavering on size since my postbaby body is a little wonky i went with the xsp and miraculously it works perfectly so i would say it does run just a little large i love the length and usually do not go with petite sizes at retailer because i like the longer lengths of the regular but this is perfect on me and there is give up top so it looks lovely and it is very soft and comfortable this will be a goto top this season
2902,35,68,277,wouldn't have given them a second look but tried them on in store of a whim love love,i really loved this top online and wanted to love it in person it is soft and the patter is okay in person the neckline is higher than i am used to also there are two buttons in the back that must be unbuttoned in order to wear the top it is difficult to button them behind your neck with the top on unfortunately i had to return this item
2903,35,69,203,wouldn't have given them a second look but tried them on in store of a whim love love,i really wanted this to work alas it had a strange fit for me the straps would not stay up and it had a weird fit under the breast it worked standing up but the minute i sat down it fell off my shoulders the fabric was beautiful and i loved that it had pockets

2905,35,71,425,wouldn't have given them a second look but tried them on in store of a whim love love,why do designers keep making crop tops?? i can't imagine this would be flattering on anyone especially someone average height and well endowed on top i looked like a football player the pattern and fabric are gorgeous so if you are like 4' tall and super tiny and can fit xxs this may work? i am between a 68 and fit a small and it was huge on me and almost was bigger at the bottom than the top such a weird cut there is a cami underneath so if it rides up that will show but that is so 80s

2910,35,76,217,wouldn't have given them a second look but tried them on in store of a whim love love,i would have loved this dress if the bust and waist were just a little more fitted i am 32c and the top was too big fit perfectly on hips the lace material means it cannot be easily altered so i chose to return the dress i would have definitely kept it if it were a better fit

3603,47,79,399,very comfortable material is good cut out on sleeves flattering,this dress is adorable  it's a perfect casual look for summer and the quality is nice with the lining (though still overpriced in my opinion) the tie detail is somewhat adjustable and i found my normal size s to fit fine (5'7 128#) where this gets me is the fact that it's dry cleantotally doesn't make sense for a dress that is essentially a fancy tshirt for summer i might bring it back for that alone since i originally planned to wear it a lot :(

3822,52,53,443,love the color and style but material snags easily,very soft and comfortable the shirt has an unusual asymmetrical seam that appears along the front righthand side of the garment (the model is positioned so that you can't see this detail from the picture i attached a picture that includes the front seam) i actually like the seam  it creates more visual interest and adds a little bit of ruching that helps hide my belly the cowl neck is very well done  there are two layers that form the cowl and i've found that it means wardrobe malfun
3823,52,54,396,love the color and style but material snags easily,nice top armholes are a bit oversized but as an older woman i'm picky about that the print is pretty and unusual it just didn't look great on me there's a slight peplum in the back that hangs nicely it's a lightweight tee fabric that's opaque i tried it on with a black bra which was barely visible great for warmer climates but there are so many gorgeous tops out now that i decided to return since summer is winding down i do recommend
3824,52,55,165,love the color and style but material snags easily,this is an adorable top that i find to be extremely comfortable i don't usually buy prints but this one is so feminine and looks great with dark wash jeans i am a 36d and the medium was a perfect fit
3825,52,56,374,love the color and style but material snags easily,i am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra it's soft and fits okay but it has zero support or shape i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support if i would have seen this is the store i would have passed over it however i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it it's comfortable so that's a redeeming quality i would not recommend for larger chested ladies though
3826,52,57,97,love the color and style but material snags easily,this tank fit well and i loved the ruffle in the back and how it layed but the front was not a good look and i will be retuning it
3827,52,58,446,love the color and style but material snags easily,i got this in the petite length size o and it fit just right i like that i didn't have to have it altered in the length; can wear with flats with plenty of clearance to the floor from the bottom hem my only beef with the design is the height of the waist i personally think that the elastic waistband looks cheap and really needs to be concealed with a belt yet because it sits so high literally right under the bustline it's a tricky one to pull off i have a wide belt that sort of does th
3828,52,59,235,love the color and style but material snags easily,i've been looking for bralettes that provide some support but not binding/tight for night time and casual wear this is a light weight bra could be a little more supportive pretty color with nice lines only downside is the retailer tag on the back  itchy (i need to remove it)
3829,52,60,242,love the color and style but material snags easily,this dress is simply beautiful and stunning it is so figure flattering and i can't wait to wear it size small worked for me and since i'm tall it fell right to my ankle which is perfect for me i could not be happier with the purchase and the keyhole in the back is a beautiful detail
3830,52,61,426,love the color and style but material snags easily,3 tags sewn in 2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3'') very itchy so i cut them out then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all also  i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work i am a b cup however this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup  so for me this would only be a lounging bralette  if it wasn't so itchy
3831,52,62,161,love the color and style but material snags easily,i recently got this on sale after looking at it forever on my wish list i'm so happy with it its very comfortable and just long enough for my torso (5'3) the pattern on the front is very flattering

3833,52,64,34,love the color and style but material snags easily,loved this top and was really happy to find it on sale
3834,52,65,207,love the color and style but material snags easily,beautiful top but delicate i wore it to school and the straps on my backpack caused some pilling other than that it is beautiful and vibrant just make sure you aren't doing/wearing anything that will rub it continuously since the fabric is delicate
3835,52,66,446,love the color and style but material snags easily,just received this in the mail tried it on and am smitten i'm usually a l but sometimes i'm a xl (if no stretch) in retailer tops i bought this one in l and i'm sure glad i did very flowy stretchy and comfortable i also bought the meda lace top from one september and they are very similar expect this is more of a tshirt and the other is more of a blouse i almost think i could've gotten a m in this because there is a lot of extra fabric at the chest which is usually never the issue for me
3836,52,67,417,love the color and style but material snags easily,love this top i kept eyeing it online and wavering on size since my postbaby body is a little wonky i went with the xsp and miraculously it works perfectly so i would say it does run just a little large i love the length and usually do not go with petite sizes at retailer because i like the longer lengths of the regular but this is perfect on me and there is give up top so it looks lovely and it is very soft and comfortable this will be a goto top this season
3837,52,68,296,love the color and style but material snags easily,i really loved this top online and wanted to love it in person it is soft and the patter is okay in person the neckline is higher than i am used to also there are two buttons in the back that must be unbuttoned in order to wear the top it is difficult to button them behind your neck with the top on unfortunately i had to return this item
3838,52,69,221,love the color and style but material snags easily,i really wanted this to work alas it had a strange fit for me the straps would not stay up and it had a weird fit under the breast it worked standing up but the minute i sat down it fell off my shoulders the fabric was beautiful and i loved that it had pockets
3839,52,70,416,love the color and style but material snags easily,"this top is so cute but it is massively babydoll shaped (a line) which is not apparent from the pictures i measured the xs i have and the chest is about 42"" and sweep is over 70"" i would definitely keep this top if it hung straighter the craftsmanship is lovely and fabric is so natural and handwoven looking i'm thinking about asking my tailor if she can take the sides in but that might ruin it as the fabric layout is cut and proportioned to this swing style"
3840,52,71,447,love the color and style but material snags easily,why do designers keep making crop tops?? i can't imagine this would be flattering on anyone especially someone average height and well endowed on top i looked like a football player the pattern and fabric are gorgeous so if you are like 4' tall and super tiny and can fit xxs this may work? i am between a 68 and fit a small and it was huge on me and almost was bigger at the bottom than the top such a weird cut there is a cami underneath so if it rides up that will show but that is so 80s
3841,52,72,447,love the color and style but material snags easily,"i have a short torso and this works well for me 34c bought the 0 there's not much stretch to the fabric so it is fitted to my chest but not in an uncomfortable way definitely doesn't hang and have extra fabric like on the model 

zipper goes almost all the way down to the bottom so it's easier to get on and off which makes up for the lack of stretch n the fabric

unlike another reviewer i found it went really well with navy pants and i wore it to a business meeting under a blazer wi"
3842,52,73,197,love the color and style but material snags easily,i love this top it is loose and comfortable it is not sheer so you don't need a cami it runs a little large so size down if you want a more tailored fit 1 criticism it catches on sharp jewelry or belts and can pull if you are not careful
3843,52,74,452,love the color and style but material snags easily,i passed up this dress so many times in the store and finally tried it on today because i wanted a casual dress while traveling in the cape i was surprised how much cuter it is on than on hanger i sized down to get a more fitting look and really made a difference for me in style i was not a fan of the way it looked so loose on model it looks really cute fitted and a bit sexy even it is lined and very comfy and can be dressed up a but for work with a cardi i believe i will get a lot of wear
3844,52,75,450,love the color and style but material snags easily,"i am so drawn to baby doll and boxy shirts so i immediately tried this on in the store i am petite and only 5'2"" so usually shirts with a lot of fabric swallow me whole but this one was still cute there is a lot more fabric than the picture lets on but i think it is still super cute and flattering i would definitely check the size chart and read comments to see if someone with your same size description has recommended a specific size for your body type i am petite and weigh about 110 lbs"
3845,52,76,234,love the color and style but material snags easily,i would have loved this dress if the bust and waist were just a little more fitted i am 32c and the top was too big fit perfectly on hips the lace material means it cannot be easily altered so i chose to return the dress i would have definitely kept it if it were a better fit
3846,52,77,180,love the color and style but material snags easily,the zipper broke on this piece the first time i wore it very disappointing since i love the design i'm actually going to try to replace the zipper myself with something stronger but annoying that it's come to that
3847,52,78,211,love the color and style but material snags easily,i usually size up with this brand small was perfect for me at 135lbs this top has a luxurious but casual feel and beautiful i am obsessed and want to wear it everyday it wears a little long and drapey but a little tight where it rolls up in the arms
3848,52,79,406,love the color and style but material snags easily,this dress is adorable  it's a perfect casual look for summer and the quality is nice with the lining (though still overpriced in my opinion) the tie detail is somewhat adjustable and i found my normal size s to fit fine (5'7 128#) where this gets me is the fact that it's dry cleantotally doesn't make sense for a dress that is essentially a fancy tshirt for summer i might bring it back for that alone since i originally planned to wear it a lot :(
3849,52,80,447,love the color and style but material snags easily,"i am usually a petite 6 but since this dress did not come in petites i tried on 4 and it fit i'm 5'1"" 112lbs so dress hit rt below knee will have it hemmed up a bit do not so overwhelming

this dress looks stunning on great vibrant color ( i have dark hair) makes this classic elegant dress look contemporary and stylish when i tried it on in store salesperson and others who happen to see it on me raved and told me to grab it i did and am glad

zipper goes almost all the way down to the bottom so it's easier to get on and off which makes up for the lack of stretch n the fabric

this dress looks stunning on great vibrant color ( i have dark hair) makes this classic elegant dress look contemporary and stylish when i tried it on in store salesperson and others who happen to see it on me raved and told me to grab it i did and am glad
